The release of v0.14 will be made today. With this all the functionality should be available to use. The initial version release
of 4.0 will be made once the documentation has been finalised and unit tests have been written to cover all of the classes.
The first release will be 4.0 to match the MATLAB/Octave/Scilab/R MDP Toolboxes that are available at
