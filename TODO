4. Write unittests for all the classes.

5. Implement own exception class.

6. Move evalPolicy* functions to be module functions, as these are useful for
   checking policies

7. Try to use rows for the Bellman computations rather than columns (perhaps
   this storage is more Pythonic? or more NumPyic?)

8.
