The first alpha release of v4.0 will be tagged today, which indicates that the
documentation and testing is starting to approach a level suitable for a final
release. A 4.0 release date has not been set, but once there are unittests for
all classes and functions, and the documentation is in a stable state, then it
can be tagged.

The release of v0.14 will be made today. With this all the functionality should
be available to use. The initial version release of 4.0 will be made once the
documentation has been finalised and unit tests have been written to cover all
of the classes. The first release will be 4.0 to match the MATLAB, Octave, 
Scilab and R MDP Toolboxes that are available at
